Plan
Dear 2a
Welcome to a fortnight of doing things a bit differently. We will begin working on a new theme 
called "Generation Z and Social Media" where we will look at generational differences among other 
things their digital habits and how social media can affects us. We will also have work with some 
fiction on this topic which presents possible dystopian and utopian futures.

Here are your tasks to do today. I have deliberately set your deadline at the end of the day so 
that you can plan your day yourselves.:
1. Upload your grammar work in the corresponding hand-in folder. 
NEW THEME: GENERATION Z AND SOCIAL MEDIA
2. VLOG!
Today, you are going to research, plan, write, practice and record your own Vlog. 
So what is a vlog? 
"A video blog or video log, usually shortened to vlog[1] /vlɒɡ/, is a form of blog for which the
 medium is video,[2] and is a form of web television. Entries can be recorded in one take or cut into multiple parts."
Your vlog should be an "informative vlog" designed to educate the viewer about a particular subject. 
How to vlog? - some suggestions from Hank Green from the youtube-channel "vlogbrothers"

2a. Find inspiration in John and Hank's videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers/videos 
and watch a few of these videos to understand the genre.
You should make your own vlog in the style of John and Hank Green. It can be about anything 
you find interesting. Your goal should be try to make us make us interested as well. 
Your audience is me and a fellow student who will peer review your video (homework) but 
try to pretend that your audience is wider - like youtube.
Some examples from the vlogbrothers of the wide range of topics:
Pineapples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zILfzEykDmY

Often these begin with rhetorical questions or some kind of segway that leads them to their 
topic. In the same way that your written work has an introduction - often "tragtindledning" 
(funnel introduction), an introduction in your video is a good idea as well. End your video 
with a conclusion - structure is important.
The video should be densely packed with you speaking for about 3½ to 4 minutes.

2b. Research your chosen topic (in-depth reading of an article about the topic should be enough)

2c. Write notes for your video.  

2d. practice what you will say in the video. You should NOT read aloud. You SHOULD speak freely 
using your notes. This is an important step! - particularly if you don't edit out your fumbling and pauses.

2e. Record (and edit) your video. Did you get it all in first take or do you need to try again? 

2f. Share your file with me and a chosen partner who will peer review your video. If Lectio is 
down my email is daen@ibc.dk

3. Join the grammar group here: https://minlaering.dk/login/opret
using the code: XVJD4Z7J
and try to do some the "præpositioner" opgaver to get acquainted with the system.

4. Peer review of vlogs (homework) - I will upload some criteria for you to look for.
